## bridge

low level faster than high level:
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeBLOCK$timeToSuccess, succbridgeHIGHLEVEL$timeToSuccess)
print(m1)
```
medium faster than high level:
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeMEDIUM$timeToSuccess, succbridgeHIGHLEVEL$timeToSuccess)
print(m1)
```
high level and block level seem to be similar-ish in "gave good instructions"
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeBLOCK$Question2, succbridgeHIGHLEVEL$Question2)
print(m1)
```
medium preferred to block level:
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeMEDIUM$Question2, succbridgeBLOCK$Question2)
print(m1)
```
medium preferred to high level:
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeMEDIUM$Question2, succbridgeHIGHLEVEL$Question2)
print(m1)
```


Always clear what to do block vs medium:
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeBLOCK$Question1, succbridgeMEDIUM$Question1)
print(m1)
```
```{r}
succbridgeMEDIUM$numBlocksDestroyed
```


Bridge: railing high level slower than medium:
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeHIGHLEVEL$HLO1, succbridgeMEDIUM$HLO1)
print(m1)
```

Bridge: railing 2 high level faster than block level:
```{r}

m1<-wiltest(succbridgeBLOCK$HLO2[], succbridgeHIGHLEVEL$HLO2)
print(m1)
```


high level less successful finish than medium level slightly non-significant:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

fishertable <- data %>% filter(scenario=="bridge") %>% filter(architect != "SimpleArchitect-BLOCK"	) %>% group_by(architect) %>% summarise(
  t=sum(wasSuccessful),
  f=n()-sum(wasSuccessful)
)

fisher.test(data.matrix(fishertable))

```

# house HLO speeds
```{r, results='asis'}

house_hlo_speed_table <--data.frame(matrix(nrow=8, ncol=3))
colnames(house_hlo_speed_table) <- architects
# row.names(house_hlo_speed_table) <- feats

for (col in seq(0,7)) {
  cat("\n\n## ")
  cat(col)
  cat("\n\n")
  for (arch in list("BLOCK", "MEDIUM", "HIGHLEVEL")) {
      nam <- paste("succhouse",arch, sep="")
      cname <- paste("HLO",col, sep="")
      cat("\n### ")
      cat(arch)
      cat("\n\n")
      dset <- Filter(nonnegative, get(nam)[,c(cname)])
      mean_results <- boot(dset, boot_mean, R = 20000);
      print(summary(dset))
      cat("\n\n")
      house_hlo_speed_table [col+1, arch] <- mean(dset)[1]

    print(boot.ci(mean_results, type="bca"))
  }
}
```



block preferred over highlevel "gave good instructions"
```{r}

wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$Question2, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$Question2)
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$timeToSuccess, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$timeToSuccess)
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$timeToSuccess, succhouseMEDIUM$timeToSuccess)
# significance tests for HLOs
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$HLO0, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$HLO0)
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$HLO1, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$HLO1)
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$HLO2, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$HLO2)
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$HLO3, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$HLO3)
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$HLO4, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$HLO4)
wiltest(succhouseBLOCK$HLO5, succhouseHIGHLEVEL$HLO5)
